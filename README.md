# wslp: We Sell Local Privileges I

Description: Says what it does on the tin. Totally not being run from my cheap
dinky box.

# wslp: We Sell Local Privileges II

Description: Arghh dammit, so my code is insecure, but surely you can't root
my box too right?

Note from author: please be nice to the instances. There are a couple of shared
instances used for part I, please don't ruin it for others :) . You can also
connect to a unique instance if you give the first part flag, but instances will
be severely limited. The unique instances will take a while to boot (on the
order of a few minutes. Don't worry, they will eventually load).
